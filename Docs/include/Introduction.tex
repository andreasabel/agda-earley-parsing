\chapter{Introduction}

	Agda is a functional programming language with a strong type system that
	supports dependent types. Dependent types allow expressing strong
	invariants and properties of data structures and programs, and even
	constructive proofs using the type system. These proofs enable programmers
	to formally verify the correctness of programs and libraries. While the
	theory underlying Agda's type system has been shown to be sound, neither
	its parser, nor later stages of its compiler have been formally verified.
	Errors in the implementations of these might change the semantics of
	compiled programs and proofs, with severe consequences. % undermining their
	usefulness.

	Parser generators are commonly used for parsers of programming languages,
	and several different generators exist today, such as Happy~\cite{Happy},
	Bison~\cite{Bison}, and Menhir~\cite{Menhir}. Parser generators are used
	for several reasons: Backus Naur Form (BNF) descriptions of grammars are
	usually more concise compared to other representations, such as hand
	written parsers. Generated parsers that are specialized for a language can
	also be faster compared to algorithms that parse any grammar and have to
	read and analyze the grammar of the target language during each parse.
	Parsers are often required to be fast, and they are the first step in what
	is usually many different passes of the entire compilation process. To this
	end, many parser generators generate parsers based on the LR(1) or LALR(1)
	parsing algorithms. These algorithms are designed mainly to be fast, but
	are unfortunately not able to parse all context-free grammars. Other
	algorithms, such as the Earley parsing algorithm~\cite{Earley}, are able to
	parse all context-free grammars, while maintaining an O(n) time complexity
	for many unambiguous grammars, such as all LR(k) grammars.

	The BNF Converter (BNFC)~\cite{BNFC} is a parser and lexer generator
	written in Haskell, which uses a labeled BNF description of the target
	language to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation, a
	parser, and a pretty-printer for the target language. BNFC supports
	multiple different back-end languages (that is, target languages for the
	generated parser itself), but none of these, nor other parts of BNFC have
	been formally verified. As with compilers, errors in parser generators can
	change the semantics of programs, yielding incorrect results.

	% A formally A fverified parser genrator could be used to generate parsers
	% for several A fdifferent formally verified compilers

	% Nice if BNFC was guarantied to generate correct parsers.

	Verified compilers have received significant attention in the research
	community. CompCert~\cite{Leroy} is a formally verified compiler for a
	subset of the C programming language. It is written in Coq, a proof
	assistant similar to Agda, and is accompanied by Coq-proofs that it
	preserves the semantics of compiled programs. 

	The aim of this thesis is to create a parser generator that can create a
	parser for any context-free grammar, using (possibly among others) the
	Earley parsing algorithm, and to formally verify, using Agda, that all
	generated parsers are correct\footnote{\emph{Correct} meaning sound and
	complete.}.
