\section*{Abstract}

The Earley parsing algorithm, named after its inventor Jay Earley, was first
described in 1968~\cite{Earley}, is a parsing algorithm for context-free
grammars capable of properly handling ambiguous parses. Compared with other
common parsing algorithms such as Valiant's or Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK),
which have a cubic best-case time complexity, Earley's can parse some grammars,
such as the LR grammars, in linear time.

In this thesis, we formalize Earley's algorithm and implement an Earley parser
in the dependently typed programming language Agda.  We also prove that the
implementation is both correct, in that it correctly accepts all input strings
conforming to a specified grammar, and correctly reject all those that do not.

We also give a short introduction to writing programs and proofs in Agda, as
well as an introduction to both parsing in general and a detailed description
of Earley's algorithm.
