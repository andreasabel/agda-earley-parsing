\section*{Abstract}

The Earley parsing algorithm, named after its inventor Jay Earley, was first
described in 1968~\cite{Earley}. It is a parsing algorithm for context-free
grammars capable of properly handling ambiguous parses. Compared with other
common parsing algorithms such as Valiant's or Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK),
which have a cubic best-case time complexity, Earley's can parse some grammars,
such as the LR grammars, in linear time. 

%TODO GLR

In this thesis, we formalize Earley's algorithm and implement a variant of an
Earley parser in the dependently typed programming language Agda. We prove that
this implementation is correct, in that it correctly accepts all input strings
conforming to a specified grammar, and that it correctly rejects all those that
do not. Although it is written to correspond to Earley's original algorithm,
with modifications made by Aycock and Horspool~\cite{aycock02}, a poor choice
of data structures means that its time complexity is significantly worse than
that of the original algorithm.

Additionally, we give a short introduction to writing programs and proofs in
Agda, as well as an introduction to both parsing in general and a detailed
description of Earley's algorithm.
